In this research, I  analyze suicide data over three decades. We will begin by introducing the dataset, detailing its variables and their types.
Next, I clean the data and convert the variables into appropriate formats. Following this, then formulate questions and seek answers through 
data processing and visualization. Finally,  employ machine learning algorithms to develop a model for predicting future suicide rates.
