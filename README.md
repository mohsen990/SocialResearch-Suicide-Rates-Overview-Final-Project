In this research, I will analyze suicide data over three decades. We will begin by introducing the dataset, detailing its variables and their types.
Next, we will clean the data and convert the variables into appropriate formats. Following this, we will formulate questions and seek answers through 
data processing and visualization. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to develop a model for predicting future suicide rates.
